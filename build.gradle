// This is a Gradle build file for OpenRefine that runs the original
// Ant tasks.  The shell script 'gradlew' can be executed at command line.
// Thereafter you can do 'gradle clean' 'gradle build', etc.
// For specific usage, visit

// This allows Gradle to execute the Ant tasks in build.xml as if they were
// Gradle tasks.  'refine build' becomes 'gradle build', etc.
